## Commands

* `npm install` - install all dependencies
* `npm run build` - build project in "build" folder
* `npm run watch`
* `npm start` - will start local server
* `npm try-last-react` - will remove current react libraries (without --save-dev), install the last ones from npm and rebuild the project. In order to reverse the project you need just run `npm install`. (By the way, it wouldn't work in windows environment)
